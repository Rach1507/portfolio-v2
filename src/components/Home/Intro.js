          Software Developer with 1.5+ years of Engineering Experience . I
          graduated from National Institute of Technology , Mysore in the year
          2022. I am currently working at Synamedia as Associate Sotware
          Engineer as part of the Core Common UI Team working on Front End
          tasks. Before graduation , I worked at OneTrust Privacy as a Full
          Stack Developer Intern for 4 months . Personally I am working on
          building a consistent healthy , engaging routine with work , hobbies
          and learning , fun on the list . I really really enjoy singing my
          heart out , my cult workouts , mid day Harry potter reads / 20 min
          anime breaks , playing silly with my 3 yo niece , friday evening swims
          and the dopamine of crossing off mundane tasks from my todo :)))
